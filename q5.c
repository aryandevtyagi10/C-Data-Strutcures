/* solution--> it doesnt matters

(=) is assignment operator whereas (==) is relational operator
if (ch=printf("")) printf is empty so ch = 0 ...which is false so else statememt is printed
if (ch=printf("abc")) printf has 3  values so ch =3
here which is true so if statement would be printed.

KEYYPOINT
x = printf ("I SEE, YOU SOON_"); 
here consdier spaces comma underscore digits all are counted as characters
x = 16
